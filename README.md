## Introduction

For your next project you'll need to find a database to work with, take this time to look for it. It can be a database containing text or any other kind of data. You can find it through webscrapping, using an API or downloading a csv file.  

If you want to work with *text*. You have some options:

- Scrape reviews from a website: using beautifulsoup or selenium
- Use an API to get information that is text-related
- Download a csv file contaning that info

It could be tweets, lines of characters per episode and per season, conversations, etc. Ideally you'd have three elements: person, group/episode/book & sentence.

- Load the file into SQL. Try to do with through Python. Otherwise, try to load it on workbench by:

1. Creating a database
2. Adding a table to the database through Table wizard (right click on the db and add a table)
3. If you encounter issues when importing, work around the formatting of the code. Transform your code so that it matches the utf-8 codification.

## Submission

No need to submit or deliver anything; focus on looking for data. Don't worry if you don't find it today.
